# Simple Chatbot (Colab)

This Colab has four cells.

1) Run Cell 1 to install google genai  
2) Run Cell 2 to upload your service account JSON  
3) Run Cell 3 to set credentials and create the client  
4) Run Cell 4 to chat in the notebook. Type exit to quit

**No memory**  
This chatbot does not remember conversation history. It does not store or load any messages. After you stop the notebook or restart the runtime everything is forgotten. During a single run it only keeps a temporary in memory list to build the next prompt.
